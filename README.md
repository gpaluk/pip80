# pip80 game console
The **pip80** is an open-source and collaborative Z80 based homebrew game console. This project was born from the idea that many existing z80 projects are built in an organic way. These projects start with simple goals but, over time, they almost always become increasingly complex.

The **pip80** is designed to be modular and aims to reduce the runaway effect of adding new components to a single board project. Each module is separated onto it's own board with the following goals:

 - Reduce single board complexity
 - Easier to isolate tests
 - Greater separation of interests

<br />

> **Warning**: **This project is just starting out and therefore not production ready.**

# üîπProject goals

The **pip80** project aims to provide a simple Z80 computer project that balances simplistic design and high performance. Ideally, anyone should be able to build a **pip80** computer, onto a breadboard, with minimal technical knowledge.

The **pip80** is based on a modular design that consists of the following modules:

- Timing
- I/O
- CPU and DMA
- Banked memory
- OPL2 audio
- VGA graphics

For increased performance, we have included a **DMA** chip into the **pip80** design. This allows us to deliver data to the sound and/or graphics modules at high speed whilst freeing the CPU for other operations.

# üîπ Components

### ‚ùáÔ∏è Timing module

<br />

**Parts list**

- 56 MHz active crystal oscillator

<br />

**Details**

For overall simplicity, our timing module includes a simple frequency divider that produces the following frequencies:

- 56.0 MHz
- 28.0 MHz
- 14.0 MHz
- 7.0 MHz
- 3.5 MHz

This means that various modules will be clocked with frequencies that do not approach their maximum tollerances. For example, our 20MHz CPU will be clocked at 14MHz and our 3.58 MHz OPL2 will be clocked at 3.5 MHz etc.
